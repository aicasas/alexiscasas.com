	Social media is an increasingly significant aspect of our daily lives; millennials and generation-X especially. As these generations becoming an increasing economic force, it begs the question, does social media play a role in our economy? I seek to find a correlation between  the social media presence of clothing retailers and their stock index.
	1.Introduction

	We are going to try and correlate a clothing retailers stock price changes with their social media presence. For example, if Nike’s stock price rose in June but fell in July, did they receive/lose a correlating number of likes, comments, video plays, etc.? Equations 1.1 and 1.2 respectively illustrate how we obtain ∆S<sub>%</sub>and ∆P<sub>%</sub> by dynamically defining <span STYLE="text-decoration:overline">S</span> and <span STYLE="text-decoration:overline">P</span>. ∆S<sub>$</sub> being the change in price, ∆S<sub>%</sub> being the same change calculated as a percentage, and <span STYLE="text-decoration:overline">S</span> being the average daily closing stock price for the time period we parse, containing N data points. The constant k is a dimensionless scale factor I intruduced where k = 1 &middot; 10<sup>-7</sup>.

 4.4 Instagram users at time of post	  </h3>
			
	  <br>
			
		January 2013 IG was to have an estimated 90 million users, as of June 2018 that figure is now 1 billion. Currently <span STYLE="text-decoration:overline">S</span> is calculated from the retailers first post up until it's most recent. I have now acquired a dataset with sparsely separated datapoints and will linearly interpolate between them to estimate IG users at any given month.

<hr style="height:1pt; visibility:hidden;" />
Instagram launched October 6<sup>th</sup>, 2010 but the earliest data point from Statista is January 2013. To address this, I simply used linear interpolation from zero to 90 million.

<hr style="height:1pt; visibility:hidden;" />
Similarly, I have no information for volume of users after June 2018. It is safer to assume in our age of information, most individuals are already on the platform and any date after June 1<sup>st</sup>, 2018 will be assigned a volume of 1 billion.

  5. Results and Next Steps
</h3>
<h3>
  5.1 Improving Social Media Presence from IG
</h3>


Adding percent change in comments, as they also reflect on the social media presence a company holds on the Instagram platform. 
<hr style="height:1pt; visibility:hidden;" />

<div align="center">
<img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?\large&space;\Delta&space;P_{\%}(t)=&space;k&space;\frac{\Delta&space;L_{\%}&space;&plus;&space;\Delta&space;C_{\%}}{U(t)}" title="\large \Delta P_{\%}(t)= k \frac{\Delta L_{\%} + \Delta C_{\%}}{U(t)}" />
  </div>

In addition, currently <span STYLE="text-decoration:overline">S</span> is caluclated using all datapoints. A possibly more accurate ∆S<sub>%</sub> might be obtained by redefining <span STYLE="text-decoration:overline">S</span> based off weekly, monthly, quarterly average (week-to-date, month-to-date, and quater-to-date for recent data points). For example if we are looking at a data point within the prior week we'd use <span STYLE="text-decoration:overline">S</span><sub>WTD</sub> and N would be five. We are only looking at trading days so we'd set 1: Monday, 2: Tuesday, 3: Wednesday, and so on.
<hr style="height:1pt; visibility:hidden;" />

<div align="center">
<img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?\large&space;\overline{S}_{WTD}=&space;\frac{\sum_{j=1}^{N}&space;{&space;S_{j}}}{N},&space;\{1&space;\leq&space;N&space;\leq&space;5\}" title="\large \overline{S}_{WTD}= \frac{\sum_{j=1}^{N} { S_{j}}}{N}, \{1 \leq N \leq 5\}" />
</div>

<h3>
  5.2 Integrating Twitter &amp; other SM Platforms
</h3>
Say we also integrate Twitter, YouTube, Facebook, and maybe even Snapchat. Then we'd have to assign each othese platforms 'weight'. Specifically, what is the weight of their platforms impact on this Social Media Presence. With the potential question of also integrating Natual Language Processing, should this Social Media Presence be interpreted in multiple variables. Relevancy, current public opinion, and historic public opinion come to mind. Is the company currently relevant? Are they in the headlines? What is the current public outlook? After Nike's Kaepernick campaign, the "current public outlook" was between political lines. What about the historic public opinion? Take Beyond Petroleum, who will forever be remembered for their oil spills.
